# ASCII Roguelike
This project was again something I did for fun, because
well I wanted to, and had nothing else to do. This game's code
can also technically be reusable although it is very messy and
should be refactored.

## Features
- Gameplay!
- Level Loading!
- Level Traversing!
- Inventory System!
- Enemies!

### Note
The mingw version will be updated more often.
(it also has curses)
