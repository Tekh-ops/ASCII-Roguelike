Now in 2018 as I'm much more experienced than I was back then, I think it's time to "remaster" these old projects and complete them in the way I never could
a few years ago.

As a more experienced programmer I can now actually implement the ideas I used back then in a proper way and also since I have done
these projects before it'll be much faster for me to reimplement and make improvements on this project.

I noticed there are many issues with the way I did things back then.
Including but not limited to:

- Hard coded Item IDS
- No usage of data driven programming which would've been very useful
- Basically nonexistant decoupling
- Also seemingly inconsistenent coding styles.
- Lots and lots of needless repetition.

 I think the time for someone to continue where this left off is I guess now. Time to do what
 I could never do last time.
